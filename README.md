## Instructions: 

- Update the `flpoly_student.md` file with your information. Make sure to practice by typesetting this Markdown using any of the options introduced in class as you seem appropriate (e.g., using **bold**, or _italicized_ fonts, including figures and links, or creating tables)

- As usual, remember to add -> commit -> push to your copy of the repo on GitHub
